# CHECK IF FILES ARE IN SAME PLACE:
# 1. Make sure unitTester.py and inventoryAllocator.py are in the same directory and file level else the import of inventoryAllocator.py will not run correctly on unitTester.py 

# HOW TO RUN FILES:
# 1. if you are running the unitTester.py file, just type 'python3 unitTester.py' and it should run. If your IDE has a run button that will also work. If there is an error, it will show up. Else it will return 'OK'. 
# 2. if you are running the inventoryAllocator.py file, then 'python3 inventoryAllocator.py'. If your IDE has a run button that will also work. However, there are no tests set up within the file itself.

# Results:
# 1. unitTester.py: 'OK' or error message
# 2. inventoryAllocator.py: list of warehouses used and item amount used from that warehouse. If request is invalid: return message and empty array. If there isn't enough inventory, it returns a list of the items and warehouses used and the items/item quantity that there is no inventory for.
